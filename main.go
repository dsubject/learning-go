/* Questions to think about:
1. How do we run the code in our project?
2. What does 'package main' mean?
3. What does 'import "fmt"' mean?
4. How is the main.go file organized?

/* Go Run vs Go Build
Go Run --> compiles and executes one or two files
Go Build --> Compiles a bunch of go source code files
Go fmt --> formats all the code in each file in the current directory
